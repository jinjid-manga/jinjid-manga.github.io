    descriptionLine1: "I've been studying Japanese for a few years now, and one of the main reasons to learn was to read manga. So I thought I could practice by translating one shots."
    descriptionLine2: "I was also surprised to discover that there was a one shot by Boichi, one of my favorite authors, that hadn't been translated. So that's where I decided to start."
    descriptionLine3: "Please, keep in mind that I'm not a professional translator (and not even a native English speaker!). If you've got some tips or comments, I'd love to hear them :)."
